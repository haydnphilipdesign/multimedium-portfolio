## Post 1 — “I made two PDFs” (TC groups)
TCs — I made two free, printable PDFs you can use in your workflow:

1) **TC Cover Sheet / Quick Ref** (works for pretty much anyone)
2) **TC Task List Sheet** (a real example built for the Poconos region — use it as a reference + customize)

If you want them, comment **“PDF”** and I’ll drop the link in the comments.

## Post 2 — Cover sheet angle (TC groups)
If you start files with a mess of scattered notes, here’s a simple fix:

I put together a **free TC Cover Sheet / Quick Ref PDF** you can print or attach to the file so the basics are always in one place.

Comment **“cover sheet”** and I’ll share the download link.

## Post 3 — Task list angle (TC groups)
Free resource for TCs: a **TC Task List Sheet** (printable PDF).

It’s a real example built for the Poconos region (where my mom’s been a TC since 2013), so it’s not “one size fits all” — but it’s a solid reference if you’re tightening your own process.

Comment **“task list”** and I’ll post the link.

## Post 4 — “Steal the structure” (TC groups)
If you’re building/cleaning up your TC workflow this year, I posted two free PDFs you can steal structure from:
- cover sheet / quick ref
- task list sheet example

Comment **“steal it”** and I’ll share the download page.

## Post 5 — Automation tie-in (optional, still value-first)
These PDFs are also examples of the kind of templates you can **auto-populate from intake data** (Jotform/Forms) — so you don’t have to retype details and your files start clean.

I posted both templates for free. Comment **“templates”** and I’ll share the link.

## Post 6 — “No email required” (reduce friction)
TCs: I put together 2 free printable PDFs (cover sheet + task list example).

No hoops — you can download without giving an email (there’s an optional “email me the link” box if you prefer).

Comment **“free”** and I’ll drop the link.

## Post 7 — Agent-friendly version (real estate groups)
Agents / broker ops: if your TC is good, help them look referral-ready.

I posted two free PDFs (TC cover sheet + task list example) that help standardize how a file starts.

If you want the link to send to your TC, comment **“send”** and I’ll drop it in the comments.
