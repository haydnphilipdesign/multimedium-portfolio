## Post Library

## REAL ESTATE / TC POSTS

### RE-TC-01 - quick website audit offer
TCs and real estate ops pros: if your site is not bringing in quality inquiries, it is usually one of three issues:
1) unclear offer
2) weak trust signals
3) no qualification step before the call

If you want, drop your site and I will give you one specific fix you can make this week.

### RE-TC-02 - referral-ready angle for agents and brokers
Agents and broker ops: a great TC is easier to refer when their site answers these fast:
- what files they take
- what the process looks like
- how to start

If your TC wants help tightening this up, comment "referral-ready" and I will share a simple checklist.

### RE-TC-03 - free resource angle
I put together free TC templates (cover sheet, task list example, intake checklist) that you can use right away.

If you want the link, comment "templates" and I will send it.

### RE-TC-04 - automation pain-point post
Most TCs do not need more leads.
They need cleaner starts and better-fit leads.

I build TC sites with fit-filtered intake, and I can add optional intake automation so half-filled submissions do not make it through.

Comment "automation" if you want the workflow breakdown.

### RE-TC-05 - headline rewrite engagement post
TCs: post your current homepage headline below and I will rewrite it so it is:
- clearer
- more specific
- better at filtering poor-fit leads

### RE-TC-06 - case-study credibility post
Recent real estate builds I have worked on focused on one thing: clearer conversion paths.

Examples:
- buyer/seller split pathways for real estate teams
- fit-focused inquiry flows for TC services
- trust-first page structure with clear next steps

If you want examples, comment "examples" and I will reply.

## SMALL BUSINESS POSTS

### SB-01 - 10-second clarity test
Small business owners: run this 10-second website test.

Can a new visitor answer these fast?
- what you do
- who you help
- what to do next

If not, your site is probably costing you leads.
Drop your site if you want one direct conversion fix.

### SB-02 - local-business positioning post
A lot of local business sites look fine but still do not convert.

Common reasons:
- generic headline
- no real proof
- weak call to action

Comment "audit" and I will send a short homepage scoring checklist.

### SB-03 - service spotlight
I help small and mid-size businesses with:
- website build/redesign (usually 4-6 weeks)
- landing pages for offers/campaigns (usually 1-3 weeks)
- ongoing conversion improvements

If you need better lead quality from your site, DM me "website".

### SB-04 - value-first mini framework
Simple homepage framework that improves conversions:
1) clear outcome headline
2) who it is for (and not for)
3) trust proof
4) one clear next step

If you want, I can review your homepage against this in the comments.

### SB-05 - local availability post
I have room for 1-2 website/landing-page projects this month.

Best fit:
- established small businesses
- service businesses with steady traffic
- owners who want better-fit inquiries, not just more clicks

Comment "slot" if you want details.

### SB-06 - landing-page offer post
Running ads or a local promo?
Send traffic to one focused landing page, not a cluttered homepage.

One page, one offer, one CTA usually wins.
Comment "landing page" if you want a fast scope example.

## COMMUNITY / LOCAL POSTS (softer sell)

### LOCAL-01 - support-local tone
Local business owners in the Poconos/NEPA:
If your website feels outdated, I am happy to share one quick improvement idea in the comments.

No pitch needed - just trying to help local businesses present themselves clearly online.

### LOCAL-02 - visibility and trust post
One of the biggest local-business problems:
People hear about you, visit your website, then still do not know what to do next.

If you want, share your site and I will point out where that friction is happening.

### LOCAL-03 - free-resource handoff post
If you know a transaction coordinator in the area, I posted free TC templates they can use immediately (cover sheet, task list example, intake checklist).

Comment "TC link" and I will share the resource page.

## EVENTS / ACTIVITIES POSTS

### EVENT-01 - event vendors
Event and wedding vendors: your website should answer three things instantly:
- what you offer
- service area + availability
- how to inquire/book

If you want a quick page review, comment "vendor audit".

### EVENT-02 - restaurant/food angle
Restaurants and food businesses: most website inquiries are lost because the key action is buried.

If your goal is catering orders, reservations, or private events, the page should be structured around that one action.
Comment "menu audit" and I will share a quick checklist.

## JOB GROUP POSTS

### JOB-01 - services offered format
Services offered:
Web design and landing pages for small businesses and real estate ops teams.

Focus:
- clearer positioning
- trust-first structure
- better lead quality

If you need a quote, message me with your current site and goals.

### JOB-02 - project availability
Available for 1-2 website/landing-page projects this month.
Best fit: established small businesses that want better inquiries from their website.

Message me "project" for scope + timeline details.

### JOB-03 - TC specialist angle
I also build websites for transaction coordinators and real estate support businesses.

If your current page is getting low-fit leads, message me "TC site" and I will send a focused plan.

## MARKETPLACE POSTS

### MKT-01 - short self-promo
Website design for local businesses and real estate support teams.
Conversion-focused pages, clean mobile experience, and clear inquiry flow.
Message for availability.

### MKT-02 - offer-style post
Website not bringing the right leads?
I do homepage + landing-page revamps focused on clarity and conversions.
Comment "review" and I will send details.
