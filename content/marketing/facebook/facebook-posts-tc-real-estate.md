## Post 1 (TC groups — simple hook)
TCs: quick question—does your website make booking feel *obvious*?

If someone lands on your site today, can they tell in 10 seconds:
- what you do (exactly),
- who you do it for,
- what it costs / how it works,
- and how to start?

If not, you’re probably getting low-fit inquiries (or none at all). I build conversion-first TC websites with clear positioning + a clean booking path.

Comment “TC” and I’ll share a couple examples + what I’d change on yours.

## Post 2 (TC groups — “not a fit” filter baked in)
I build websites for established transaction coordinators who want fewer low-fit leads and more qualified calls.

Not a fit if you want a generic template or you’re not ready to respond to leads quickly.

If you *are* a fit: I can usually spot the biggest reason a TC site isn’t converting in under 2 minutes.

Drop your site below (or comment “audit”) and I’ll tell you the biggest fix.

## Post 3 (TC groups — value checklist)
TC lead quality comes down to 3 things on your site:
1) Offer clarity (scope + what you don’t do)
2) Proof (real signals, not fluff)
3) A qualification-first intake/booking flow

If you want, I’ll paste my “TC homepage” checklist in the comments—comment “checklist”.

---

## Post 4 (TC groups — optional automation add-on, clearly secondary)
Most TCs don’t actually need “more leads.”
They need *better* leads + cleaner file starts.

My main work: conversion-first TC websites (positioning, copy, design, booking).

Optional add-on if you want it: intake automation that forces required fields and outputs a clean cover-sheet style summary (email + optional PDF), so every file starts organized.

If that sounds like your pain, comment “automation” and I’ll share what it includes.

---

## Post 5 (TC groups — pain + outcome, minimal pitch)
If you’re constantly chasing missing info after a new file comes in, your intake system is doing the opposite of its job.

A good intake:
- won’t accept half-filled submissions
- adapts based on buyer/listing/dual
- flags missing items immediately
- generates a clean summary you can drop into the file

I can build the site + (optionally) set up the intake workflow in the tools you already use. Comment “setup” and I’ll share details.

## Post 6 (agent / real estate groups — referral angle)
Agents: if your TC is great, they should be easy to refer.

Most TCs lose referrals because their site doesn’t clearly answer:
- what files they take
- turnaround expectations
- pricing / process
- how to start

I build TC websites that make referrals feel safe + obvious. If you have a TC you love, tag them—I’ll share a quick “TC website must-haves” list in the comments.

---

## Post 7 (agent groups — “I’ll review your TC’s site”)
Agents/broker ops: want a quick sanity check?

Reply with your TC’s website and I’ll tell you (in plain English) whether it helps or hurts referrals—and what to change.

No pitch needed. If it’s solid, I’ll say that too.

---

## Post 8 (TC groups — “1-liner positioning” offer)
TCs: if you had to describe your service in one sentence, what would it be?

Most sites fail because the headline is vague (“Seamless transactions” etc.).

Reply with your current headline and I’ll rewrite it to be:
- specific
- premium
- and self-filtering (so low-fit leads don’t book)

---

## Post 9 (TC groups — “slots” style)
I’m taking on 1–2 website builds for transaction coordinators this month:
- conversion-first website (positioning + copy + design)
- qualification-first lead capture
- optional done-for-you intake automation (you own the tools/accounts)

If you want info, comment “slots” and I’ll drop the link in a comment.

---

## Post 10 (TC groups — product-minded positioning)
I work with transaction coordination workflows a lot (websites + ops).

My approach is simple: make your offer obvious, make the next step easy, and remove the friction that creates back-and-forth.

If you post your site, I’ll give you one conversion fix you can implement this week.
